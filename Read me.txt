Project: An online store web site that features products from a fictional company, Bertha's Deluxe Chocolates. This company produces fine chocolates and confections for sale over the Internet. You will create the online store front for the company that allows customers to browse the various product offerings, and purchase products online. Your site must feature a shopping cart that allows customers to add or remove items. Additionally, you will create a report page for management that shows all orders placed, ordered by date.

1. Links: Home, Products, Order Online, About Us, Contact.
2. Home: Brings the user back to the main page.
3. Products: A description of the types of candies available for order. Products should be organized by category.
4. Order Online: An order form for the customer to select the types of chocolates to order and the quantity of each. Look at existing online order forms for ideas of the best way to organize your checkout form. Users must be able to edit the quantity or remove an item. The total (extended amount) for an item must change dynamically when the user changes the quantity field. At the bottom your form should show a grand total for the order.
5. The About Us and Contact links are static pages with appropriate fictional details.
